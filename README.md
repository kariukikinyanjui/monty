Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used in computer science to manage collections of items with specific access and ordering behaviors. They both operate on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) or last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle, but they have distinct characteristics and use cases.

Stacks:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates – you can only remove the top plate, and to access plates further down, you need to remove the ones on top first.

Key operations:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Common applications of stacks include expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms (like the back button in a web browser), and maintaining function call history (call stack in programming languages).

Queues:
A queue is another linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It's like a line of people waiting in a queue – the person who arrived first gets served first, and new people join at the end of the line.

Key operations:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes the front element from the queue.
Front: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
Common applications of queues include task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and print job management.
